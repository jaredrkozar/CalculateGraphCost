# CalculateGraphCost

CalculateGraphCost is a simple Java command line program that lets you calculate the shortest amount of paths it will take to get from one vertex to another, along with the total cost, in a weighted graph.

#How to download

1. Click download in the upper right hand corner
2. In your terminal window, cd to the folder where the graph.java file is located
3. Type "java Graph" to run the program.

#How to use

1. Enter how many edges and vertices you want in your graph
2. Enter the points you want in your graph.
3. Enter the cost per edge, and the starting and endong vertex.
4. The terminal will then print out the total number of paths beteween the two verticies, and the total cost it took to get from the starting vertex to the ending vertex.
